DEVELOPMENT OF THE FUZZY LOGIC ALGORITHM OF DATA SURVEY AND ANALYSIS FOR DISASTER RELIEF SYSTEMS
N.Yu.Lisay¹, A.V. Sinitsyn2
Summary: The article is devoted to the development of a client-server architecture of a prototype system for collecting and analyzing data on location, damage, needs in the search for the population during natural disasters. The article poses the problem of identifying the number of requests under uncertainty and proposes a solution using fuzzy logic and artificial intelligence approaches..
Keywords: system prototype, client-server architecture, fuzzy logic, neural networks
